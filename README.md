# Arcade Suite
This is the repo for our Bachelors project.
The goal of this project is to let agents play the modified [HackAtari](https://github.com/k4ntz/HackAtari) versions of Atari2600 
Games with the help of [OC_Atari](https://github.com/k4ntz/OC_Atari). We are going to implement PvP, PvE and EvE modes and visualize the decision making of Agents when they are playing using [ScoBots](https://github.com/k4ntz/SCoBots).
